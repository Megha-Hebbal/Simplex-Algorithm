# Simplex-Algorithm

### Project Description
This project implements the Simplex algorithm in Python to solve linear programming problems. The algorithm is designed to minimize a linear objective function, subject to linear equality constraints, by iterating through the vertices of the feasible region.

In this example, the code is applied to maximize profit for a farmer by determining the optimal allocation of land for growing Wheat and Barley, while taking into account resource constraints such as available labor, land, and other inputs.

### Requirements
* Python 3.x
* NumPy: The algorithm requires numpy for efficient matrix and vector computations.
Install dependencies using: `pip install numpy`
